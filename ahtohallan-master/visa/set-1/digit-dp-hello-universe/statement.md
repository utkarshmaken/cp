# Note
* This question was not present in the **OA**. It's just meant to help you upsolve the **Digit Sum** question.
* The original question in the test was [Simplify Directory Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/). You should try to solve it on **LeetCode** after the contest.
* The only difference from the easy version is the constraint on $d$.

# Statement
Find the number of integers in the range $[low, high]$ which contain the digit $d$ exactly $cnt$ times.

# Input Format
* The first line contains the number of test-cases
* Each test-case is described by a single line containing 4 integers, $low, high, d, cnt$ (in the same order).

# Constraints
* $1 \leq t \leq 100$
* $0 \leq d \leq 9$
* $0 \leq cnt \leq 50$
* $1 \leq low \leq high \leq 10^{18}$
