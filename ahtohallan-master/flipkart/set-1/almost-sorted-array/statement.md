# Description
You are given an array consisting of `n` elements.

In one **move**, you can delete **exactly** one element from the array.

An **almost-sorted** arrray is an array which can be sorted(in **strictly increasing order**) by performing **atmost** one move.

Find the minimum moves required to convert the array into an **almost-sorted-array**.


# Constraints
* ` 1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`


# Explanation of Samples Cases
In sample case-1, in one move, you can delete 6. Now the array is **almost sorted**.

In the second case, the array is already **almost sorted**.
