* **Important Note** : Before you read further, you might want to [enable syntax highlighting](../../documentation/documentation.md). Without it, the linked codes would be almost unreadable. Moreover, the instructions are different from last time (as I found an easier way to retain **Github flavoured syntax highlighting**).

# Stress Testing for Dummies
The best way to learn is by debugging your incorrect solution. However, that might be too difficult for large test-cases.

# Practice Problems
There were 2 classical DP questions. Moreover, DP is a recurring theme in a lot of contests. To get better at it, start by solving some standard DP questions. You can find a detailed description [here](../../practice-problems/dp/atcoder/dp-atcoder.md)

# Editorial
This was a pretty easy contest I believe. The questions didn't require much thinking. You just needed to convert them to some classical question and then use the old-algorithms as it is.
