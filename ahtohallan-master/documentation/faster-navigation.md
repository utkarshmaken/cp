# Scrolling via Keyboard
In *Google Chrome*, you can use the **SpaceBar** to scroll half a page.

# Jump to the top of the page
* **Windows**
	* Use the **Home** button. It's usually located around the *Number-Pad*.
	* If you are using a Laptop keyboard, it might be integrated into the arrow-keys.
* **Mac**
	* **Cmd + Up** or **Ctrl + Up** 

# Jump to the bottom of the page
* **Windows**
	* Use the **End** button. It's usually located around the *Number-Pad*.
	* If you are using a Laptop keyboard, it might be integrated into the arrow-keys.
* **Mac**
	* **Cmd + Down** or **Ctrl + Down** 

# Using the Table-of-Contents
* Jump to the top of the page.
* Click on the desired section or sub-section.
* This would ensure that the relevant portion start at the top of your screen.

# Navigating History after using TOC
You might notice that if you use **TOC** to navigate the page, you'd have a hard time going back to the last visited page. This is due to the fact that the browser considers each usage of **TOC** as a separate link. Hence, you need to undo all your `toc-history` to go back.

**Workaround** : I haven't found a concrete solution yet(or it's not really a problem, but a feature). However, I do provide the relative link of the *Editorial Page* before the **TOC**. Hence, if you want to navigate back, jump to the top of the page and click on `Editorial Page`.

# Power-Users
If you want a keyboard-centric workflow for browsing, consider adding the [Vimium Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en). With it, you can navigate lightning fast without touching your mouse. Some salient features.

* Navigate to the top or bottom of the page quickly.
* Home-row keys for page navigation.
* Jump to any link/toc with atmost 3-4 keystrokes.
* Faster Tab Manipulation.

Of course, to leverage the full power, you should be familiar with **VIM**.
