# Atcoder Educational DP Contest

You can access the questions [here](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp)

As of now, I've only solved `12/26` questions, and hence I'll just recommend these 12 questions for now.

The questions are arranged in increasing order of difficulty (as perceived by me).

## Model Solution
1. [Frog 1](frog-1.cpp)
2. [Frog 2](frog-2.cpp)
3. [Vacation](vacation.cpp)
4. [Knapsack 1](knapsack-1.cpp)
5. [Stones](stones.cpp)
6. [Deque](deque.cpp)
7. [Knapsack 2](knapsack-2.cpp)
8. [Independent Set](independent-set.cpp)
9. [Slimes](slimes.cpp)
10. [Matching - Iterative](matching-tle.cpp) | [Matching - Memoization](matching.cpp) 

A bit advanced :

11. [Candies Naive DP](candies-naive-dp.cpp) | [Candies Optimized](candies.cpp)
12. [Flowers - Naive](flowers-tle.cpp) | [Flowers - Optimized](flowers.cpp)


## Hints and Time Complexity
The first step in DP is getting your **function defintion** correct along with a fair idea of the expected time complexity. Although you should aim to develop this skill, it is but natural that you get stuck in the initial phase.

Hence, I've prepared a list of the DP definition and expected time-complexity of all the 12 questions. You can access them using this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lx4ntv8VzwnSUBj7r7Q3p6hE-ajT--Ny/view?usp=sharing)
