* **Important Note** : Before you read further, you might want to [enable syntax highlighting](../../documentation/documentation.md). Without it, the linked codes would be almost unreadable. Moreover, the instructions are different from last time (as I found an easier way to retain **Github flavoured syntax highlighting**).
* Save your wrists from **RSI**. [Learn to navigate faster using TOC](../../documentation/faster-navigation.md)


The next contest might take a while as I'm busy with some other stuff. In the meanwhile, I'd suggest you to [upsolve all the previous contests](../../invitation-link/invitation-link.md). If you are a beginner, consider solving [basic questions](https://github.com/Just-A-Visitor/Algorithmic-Pseudocode/blob/master/Interview%20Preparation/Prerequisite/ReadMe.md) first.
