**Important Note** : Before you read further, you might want to [enable syntax highlighting](../../documentation/documentation.md). Without it, the linked codes would be almost unreadable. Moreover, the instructions are different from last time (as I found an easier way to retain **Github flavoured syntax highlighting**).
