To protect the intergrity of the participants, we are introducing some major changes. 

* The **editorial** would be published, however, the **model solution** would not be provided, nor will the codes of other participants be linked. You can comment on the problem's discussion thread on the `issues` page if you are facing difficulties with implementing the ideas of the editorial.
* Once the contest is over, you won't be able to see the **Status/Standing/Participants**.
* To access the **past contests** :
	* If you took part in the original contest, search the contest name on the `issues` page. (Use the label `invitation`). Click on `Contest Page`.
	* If you didn't participate in the original contest, but did upsolve it or have seen the problems atleast once, follow the same steps as above and you'll be able to acccess it.
	* If you're accessing it for the first time, follow the same steps. In the last comment, you'll find the latest invitation link. The next time you should follow step-1.
* The **invitation-links** might expire frequently (without notice). If this happens, search for the contest name on the `issues` page and look for the last comment. It would contain the latest link.
